# libscmp

A safe, **sane** Rust interface to `libseccomp` on Linux.

Note: This is not a high-level interface; most functions/methods in this library directly correspond to a `libseccomp` function. However, this library provides a sane, usable interface to `libseccomp`, something that seems to be lacking.

## Building

You need `libseccomp` installed to build.
